Exercise 2 - Selection
Write a program to calculate the amount to be paid for a rented vehicle.
• Input the distance the van has travelled
• The first 30 km is at a rate of 50/= per km.
• The remaining distance is calculated at the rate of 40/= per km.


#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int distance;
	float amount;
	
	printf("Enter the diatance travelled : ");
	scanf("%d",&distance);
	
	if(distance<=30)
	{
		amount = distance * 50;
		printf("Total Amount : %f",amount);
		
	}
	else 
	{
		//amount = distance * 40
		amount = 30 * distance + (distance - 30) * 40;
		printf("Total Amount : %f",amount);
	}
	return 0;
}
